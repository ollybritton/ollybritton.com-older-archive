This is one of the slightly more cringey projects I've made, probably because it was made in 2016. I updated it when Vine got shutdown to make it slightly more cringey. The idea is that when you press the "Random Vine" button it will generate the name of a vine that <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jacob_Sartorius">"Jacoub Sartorius"</a> might make. For extra cringe, you can also press the "Random Song" button, which makes it generate a random song name.
