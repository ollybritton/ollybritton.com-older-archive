I'm not sure this actually works properly.

This Python script (attempts?) to create new text based off a file that you provide it. For example, if you provide it with the works of Shakespeare it will generate new Shakespeare-like text. For example:

<code>
Unreasonable creatures feed upon,
Is my house; hear from thee, pretty York, Berkeley, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Then fiery wheels:
Now, ere men can come to time
Envied against Aufidius and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this do I drown'd these senators, the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the king's;
Or, like conies after
</code>

Not exactly poetry.
