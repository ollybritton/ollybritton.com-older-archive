This is one of my favourite projects. Basically, it maps a sample from the iconic Daft Punk song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDpmVUEjagg">"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"</a> to a key on your keyboard, meaning you can recreate the song from your keyboard. The bottom keys <code>(Z, X, C, V, B, N, M)</code> are mapped to drums.

What's more, if you hold down <code>"="</code> and press the sample keys again, the samples are still from the song, but a different variant. Here's some keys you can try:

<ul>
<li><code>QWERTYUIOPASDFGH</code> - The normal chorus</li>
<li><code>QTWYEURIODPFAGSH</code> - My favourite section</li>
</ul>
