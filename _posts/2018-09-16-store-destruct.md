This was quite a fun project to make. The idea is that you open this webpage on a computer in a computer store and click on the button. It will then shows a blank screen until somebdy touches the computer, and once they do, it starts a countdown that progressively beeps louder and says the computer is going to expolde, hopefully scaring them a bit.

It also gives the customer who touched the computer instructions on what to do, like hide under the computer desk to protect themselves from the shrapnel.
