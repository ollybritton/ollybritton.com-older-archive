I made this a few years ago, and I don't think I programmed it correctly so I'm not actually entirely sure if it works. The idea is that using a set of differential equations, you can model a disease spreading. I'm pretty sure that I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWQpUgm-d8s">this video</a>, which used an Excel spreadsheet.
