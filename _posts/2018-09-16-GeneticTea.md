This is the first GitHub project that somebody other than me or my brother has commented/worked on. The idea of the script was to generate an ideal cup of tea for you by utilizing a genetic algorithm to make the cups of tea "evolve" into their ideal form.

However, my first script did not work properly because it lacked one of the core things needed for evolution: breeding. So a kind stranger re-created the entire script, added in loads of new things and added breeding of cups of tea.
